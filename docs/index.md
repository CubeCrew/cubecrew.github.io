# About

Cube Crew is an "indie" game development team. We do funny things like make decent games with no funding. Still working on that, though.

## Game List
uhhhh CLOSE YOUR EYES, ACT LIKE THERE'S GAMES HERE

We do actually have a lot of in-development games. Here's a few that might actually make it out alive:

- KuBeats

Highway rhythm game with 4 keys. just 4. there's no more lanes. go away. nothing here. trust me. 
(Community charting support, with maybe even forums?!?!?!?!?!)

- Project Aconcagua

Celeste completely rewritten in Haxe, with out-the-box modding support. thank you in advance polymod

- The Dashlands

Always been a fan of DELTARUNE, So I thought I'd make my own RPG. Something goes a tad bit wrong, though. Think I might've spilled some _R2xpdGNoZXM=_ on the source code.

- MouseVoltex

SoundVoltex, but with a mouse. Two highway lanes, one wheee haha funny ping pong paddle. more of a personal project, tho - kube
